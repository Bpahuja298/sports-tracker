# 🔧 Fixing Xcode Signing Issue

## 📱 Quick Fix for "Signing requires a development team"

### **What you're seeing:**
- Error: "Signing for 'TennisTournamentApp' requires a development team"
- Status shows: "Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities editor"

### **Simple Solution:**

1. **You're already in the right place** (Signing & Capabilities tab)

2. **Click "Add Account..."** next to "Team"
   - Sign in with your Apple ID (free account works fine)
   - This creates a personal development team

3. **Select your team** from the dropdown
   - After adding account, select your Apple ID team
   - Bundle identifier will be automatically managed

4. **Click the ▶️ Play button** to run the app
   - Xcode will build and launch on simulator
   - First build may take a few minutes

### **Alternative: Use Simulator Only**

If you don't want to sign in with Apple ID:
1. **Change target** from your iPhone to "iPhone 16 Pro Simulator"
2. **Simulator doesn't require signing**
3. **Click ▶️ Play button**

### **What Happens Next:**

Once signing is fixed:
- ✅ **App builds successfully**
- ✅ **iOS Simulator opens** (or installs on your iPhone)
- ✅ **Tennis Tournament app launches**
- ✅ **You'll see tournament list** with your data
- ✅ **Touch navigation works** between screens
- ✅ **Pull-to-refresh** updates data

### **Expected App Behavior:**

**Tournament List Screen:**
- Shows 69+ tennis tournaments
- Pull down to refresh
- Tap any tournament to view events

**Tournament Events Screen:**
- Live match data with status indicators
- 🔴 LIVE, ✅ Finished, ⏰ Scheduled matches
- Pull down to refresh events
- Back button returns to tournament list

## 🎾 Your React Native App is Ready!

The signing issue is the only thing preventing your fully-built Tennis Tournament app from running. Once you add your Apple ID account, you'll see your mobile app working with the same tournament data as your web version!
